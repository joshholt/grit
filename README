Grit is just a simple tool to align your multiple repositories. It's not overwhelmingly complex; it's just a proxy for git commands to your main repo and your other repos.

Get started:
Drop the grit.rb somewhere
chmod +x it
ln -s ~/path/to/grit.rb /usr/local/bin/grit

Go to your project
grit init

Will generate .grit/config.yml

Sample config.yml
--- 
:root: /Users/Bono/the_world
:repositories: 
  - :name: Sproutcore
    :path: frameworks/sproutcore
  - :name: SCUI
    :path: frameworks/scui

In your main proj directory
grit st

>>

[master][~/orion]$ grit st
